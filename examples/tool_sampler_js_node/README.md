**Usage:**

npm install
npm run start
```

You can try out the following tools:
- Frankfurters: Real-time foreign exchange rate API
- TMDB (requires API key): Movie-related information
- New York Times (requires API key): Articles and news content

To use TMDB, you need to obtain an API key from the [following link](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).
For the New York Times API, you also need to get an API key from their [developer portal](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started).

Additionally, if you're using an OpenAI model, you must provide an OpenAI API key as well.
