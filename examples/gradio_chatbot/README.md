# Ailoy Gradio Chatbot Example

This example shows how easily you can integrate Ailoy into a Gradio app, with support for streaming responses, reasoning, and tool usage.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync
uv run main.py

* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
* To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your web browser and start asking questions.

This example uses the Frankfurter tool to demonstrate Ailoy's tool-calling capabilities. Try asking questions about currency exchange rates to see it in action.
