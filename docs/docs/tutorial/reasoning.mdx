# Reasoning

Reasoning(thinking) is an advanced capability of AI that enables it to tackle complex
tasks through explicit, step-by-step logical inference. Reasoning models break
down problems into smaller sub-tasks rather than solving them in a single pass.
Compared to direct answer generation, it offers two key advantages:

1. Improved problem-solving intelligence
2. Transparent and traceable intermediate reasoning steps

This functionality is particularly well-suited for domains that require
multi-step reasoning, such as scientific analysis, legal interpretation, or
strategic decision-making. However, since the reasoning step needs additional
computation and memory usage, it can increase latency and overall resource
consumption. Therefore, it’s important to enable reasoning only when necessary,
based on the complexity of your use case.

## Hybrid Reasoning Models

Some modern models, such as Qwen3, are designed as hybrid reasoning models.
These models can switch between normal (direct-generation) and thinking (reasoning) modes depending on your configuration.

Ailoy fully supports this hybrid capability. You can explicitly turn the reasoning process on or off via the reasoning option.
When enabled, the model engages in structured, step-by-step inference—producing a detailed “thinking trace” before the final answer.

Note that not all models are hybrid reasoning models.
Some models always perform reasoning(like GPT-o series), while others do not support reasoning.
In such cases, setting `reasoning=True` will have no effect—the model’s reasoning behavior.

Please check the model’s documentation to understand whether it supports explicit reasoning control.


### How to enable reasoning

To activate reasoning mode, simply specify the reasoning option when querying the agent:

<CodeTabs>

```python
for resp in agent.query(
    "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
    reasoning=True
):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  { reasoning: true }
)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

Note: Qwen3-0.6b is too small to perform effective reasoning.
For complex tasks, we recommend using larger models.
