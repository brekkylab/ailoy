# Reasoning

Reasoning is an advanced capability of AI that enables it to tackle complex
tasks through explicit, step-by-step logical inference. Reasoning models break
down problems into smaller sub-tasks rather than solving them in a single pass.
Compared to direct answer generation, it offers two key advantages:

1. Improved problem-solving intelligence
2. Transparent and traceable intermediate reasoning steps

This functionality is particularly well-suited for domains that require
multi-step reasoning, such as scientific analysis, legal interpretation, or
strategic decision-making. However, since the reasoning step needs additional
computation and memory usage, it can increase latency and overall resource
consumption. Therefore, itâ€™s important to enable reasoning only when necessary,
based on the complexity of your use case.

Reasoning may not be supported on some models. The `Qwen3` model currently available in Ailoy supports reasoning.

## How to enable reasoning

In Ailoy, You can activate reasoning feature by simply specifying an option `reasoning`.

<CodeTabs>

```python
for resp in agent.query(
    "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
    reasoning=True
):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  { reasoning: true }
)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

### Dismiss reasoning messages

Since reasoning is an internal process, you might want to ignore it in the output.
In such cases, you can use the `ignore_reasoning_messages` option to make `Agent` to dismiss the reasoning tokens.

```python
for resp in agent.query(
    "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
    reasoning=True,
):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  { reasoning: true }
)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

:::note 
Note: Qwen3-0.6b is too small to perform effective reasoning.
We recommend using a model with bigger parameters for reasoning tasks.
