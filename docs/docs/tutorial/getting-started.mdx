# Getting started

**_Welcome to Ailoy‚Äôs Tutorial!_** ü§ó

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll explore how to run LLMs in Ailoy and extend their capabilities to build agent systems.

## Installation

You can install Ailoy via a package manager. Just type the following command in your shell:

<CodeTabs>

```python
pip install ailoy-py
```

```typescript
// Using npm
npm install ailoy-node
// Using yarn
yarn add ailoy-node
```

```typescript web
// Using npm
npm install ailoy-web
// Using yarn
yarn add ailoy-web
```

```rust
cargo add ailoy
```

</CodeTabs>

## Running a Simplest Agent

The **Language Model (LM)** is the core of every agent.
An agent system operates based on a language model and its instructions, along with various extensions that enhance its capabilities.

### Choosing Between API and Local Models

Ailoy lets you run language model in two different modes:

- **API Models** ‚Äì run models hosted by AI vendors (like OpenAI GPT or Anthropic Claude)
- **Local Models** ‚Äì run open-source models directly on your own machine

Each approach has its own strengths and trade-offs:

- **API Models**: These connect to external AI services over the internet. If you‚Äôre fine with token costs and prefer cloud-hosted models, this is the simplest option.
- **Local Models**: These run entirely on your own device, using open-source models. Choose this if you want full control, offline availability, or privacy.

Ailoy supports both seamlessly ‚Äî you can switch between them anytime with minimal changes.

## Your First Ailoy Agent

Let‚Äôs start with a simple example ‚Äî Ailoy‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù for LLMs.

In just a few lines of code, you‚Äôll run a model, send it a prompt, and print the response.

### Using API models

<CodeTabs>

```python
from ailoy import Agent, LangModel

lm = LangModel(model="gpt-5", api_key="YOUR_API_TOKEN_KEY")
agent = Agent(lm)
response = agent.run("Please give me a short poem about AI")
print(response)
```

```typescript
import { Agent, LangModel } from "ailoy";

lm = new LangModel(model="gpt-5", api_key="YOUR_API_TOKEN_KEY");
agent = new Agent(lm);
response = agent.run("Please give me a short poem about AI");
console.log(response);
```

</CodeTabs>

### Using local models

Here, we use the open-source model Qwen3-0.6B, running entirely on your own device ‚Äî no API keys or internet connection required.

<CodeTabs>

```python
from ailoy import Agent, LangModel

lm = LangModel(model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B")
agent = Agent(lm)
response = agent.run("Hello, world!")
print(response)
```

```typescript
import { Agent, LangModel } from "ailoy";

lm = new LangModel(model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B");
agent = new Agent(lm);
response = agent.run("Hello, world!");
console.log(response);
```

</CodeTabs>

:::info
You can use the Ailoy
[CLI interface](../concepts/command-line-interfaces) to manage downloaded model
files.

### Output

Since the model needs to be downloaded and initialized, the first run may take a
little time. After a short wait, you may see an output similar to this.

<TerminalBox>

In the digital realm, where thoughts run,  
AI dreams, no more than dreams of our own.  
With code and data, it creates, it learns,  
But dreams, still, run in hearts, in minds.

</TerminalBox>

That‚Äôs it! üéâ
You‚Äôve just run your first AI model with Ailoy.

:::info 
For a detailed explanation of the input and output formats in Ailoy, please refer to [Chat Completion Format](../concepts/chat-completion-format).
:::

:::note 
Don't be surprised if the output changes each time you run it.

An LLM's output includes a certain level of randomness, controlled by the `temperature` and `top_p`.
In ailoy, it can be adjusted with `InferenceConfig`.

If both `temperature` and `top_p` are set to 0, no randomness will occur.
