# Integrate with MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol developed by Anthropic
to standardize how language models interact with external systems—such as tools,
memory backends, and context managers. MCP enables structured, dynamic
communication between an LLM and its environment, empowering models to access
external tools, retrieve real-time information, and perform complex, multi-step
reasoning.

### Using MCP with Ailoy

Ailoy Agents can seamlessly integrate with existing MCP-compliant servers. For
example, the following code connects to the official GitHub MCP server:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
    StdioServerParameters(
        "github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    )
)
```

```typescript
await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer("github", {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
});
```

</CodeTabs>

This launches the GitHub MCP server as a subprocess using standard I/O for
communication. The agent automatically discovers the tools exposed by the server
and registers them into its internal toolset.

### Querying via MCP Tools

Once the tools are registered, the agent can invoke them as needed when you call
the query() method:

<CodeTabs>

```python
question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
for resp in agent.query(question):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
const question =
  "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

This demonstrates how the agent utilizes the GitHub MCP tools to search
repositories and summarize their contents.

The repository **brekkylab/ailoy** is a **lightweight library** for building AI applications, such as **agent systems** or **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines**. It is designed to simplify the integration and usage of AI models, allowing developers to import and use AI capabilities with minimal effort.

### Key Features:
- **Support for Local and Cloud AI Models**: It enables the use of local AI models (e.g., Qwen3 variants) and cloud APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude).
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Supports conversational agents with customizable system messages.
- **Reasoning and Tool Calling**: Facilitates reasoning-based workflows and integration with tools (including \`MCP\`).
- **Vector Store Support**: Built-in integration with vector databases like \`Faiss\` and \`ChromaDB\`.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux, with specific hardware requirements for local model execution.

### Supported Models:
- **Local Language Models**: Qwen3 variants (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 30B-A3B).
- **Cloud Models**: OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude.
- **Embedding Models**: BAAI/bge-m3.

### Use Cases:
- **Chatbots**: Build simple or advanced chatbots with local or cloud models.
- **RAG Pipelines**: Combine retrieval and generation for enhanced AI applications.
- **Custom AI Agents**: Create agents with reasoning capabilities and tool integration.

### Requirements:
- **Hardware**: At least 8GB of GPU memory is recommended for most models, with higher requirements for larger models like Qwen3-8B (12GB).
- **OS**: Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), or Linux with specific versions and drivers.

### Getting Started:
- **Node.js**: Install via \`npm install ailoy-node\` and use TypeScript examples.

        StdioServerParameters(
            command="npx",
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
        )
    )

    question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
    for resp in agent.query(question):
        agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
import { startRuntime, defineAgent, LocalModel } from "ailoy-node";

(async () => {
  const rt = await startRuntime();
  const agent = await defineAgent(rt, LocalModel({ id: "Qwen/Qwen3-8B" }));

  // Add tools from Github MCP server
  await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer("github", {
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  });

  const question =
    "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
  for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
    agent.print(resp);
  }
})();
```
