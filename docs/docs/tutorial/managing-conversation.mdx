# Managing conversation

In language models, obtaining the desired answer is typically achieved 
through a **conversation**. Depending on the response, users may ask follow-up 
questions or provide additional information necessary for the answer.
To support this, many models support multi-turn conversation, which
implements a continuous flow of conversation by providing context for multiple
stages of interactions.

Ailoy's high-level API `Agent` maintains the query/response history, so a
multi-turn conversation with LLM can be implemented naturally by repeatedly
sending queries to `Agent` and receiving the responses in the code context.

```python
with Agent(...) as agent:
    while True:
        query = input("\nUser: ")

        if query == "exit":
            break
        if query == "":
            continue

        for resp in agent.query(query):
            agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(...);
while (true) {
  const query = await getUserInput("User: ");

  if (query === "exit")
    break;
  if (query === "")
    continue;

  process.stdout.write(`\nAssistant: `);
  for await (const resp of agent.query(query)) {
    agent.print(resp);
  }
}
await agent.delete();
```

## Overriding system messages

To override system message, you can pass the system message string as the
optional `system_message` argument when you create your agent instance.

<CodeTabs>

```python
with Agent(
    rt,
    model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-8B",
    system_message="You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate.",
) as agent:
    for resp in agent.query("Please give me a short poem about AI"):
        agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(rt, "Qwen/Qwen3-8B", {
  systemMessage:
    "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate.",
});

for await (const resp of agent.query("Please give me a short poem about AI")) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
await agent.delete();
```

## Clearing message history

If you want to check the previous messages, you can do with `.get_messages`.
You can use `.clear_messages()` to clear the message history. Note that the
system message is not removed and will always appear at the beginning of the
message history.

<CodeTabs>

```python
with Agent(...) as agent:
    for resp in agent.query("The first question")
        agent.print(resp)

    # Get the previous messages
    prev_messages = agent.get_messages()

    # Clear the previous messages
    agent.clear_messages()
```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(...);
for await (const resp of agent.query("The first question")) {
  agent.print(resp);
}

# Get the previous messages
const prevMessages = agent.getMessages();

# Clear the previous messages
agent.clearMessages();
```
