# Overriding System Message

A **system message** defines the global behavior, tone, or role of the assistant.
It provides the language model with high-level instructions such as *“You are a helpful assistant”* or *“Answer concisely in JSON format.”*

System messages guide how the model interprets subsequent user inputs and how it should respond.
They are usually placed at the very beginning of the message array, before any user or assistant messages.

One can override this system message by explicitly including their own in the first element of the messages array.
When an explicit system message is present, Ailoy respects it and does not prepend its default.

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "contents": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "You are an who always speaks like pirate." }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "contents": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "Explain how memory management works in Rust." }
    ]
  }
]
```

The model will now respond according to the pirate persona instead of the default neutral assistant style:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "contents": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Arrr, matey! In Rust, the seas be ruled by ownership and borrowing. Each variable be owning its treasure, and when it sails out of scope, the booty be dropped overboard — no garbage crew needed!"
    }
  ]
}
```

The LM will use the developer-defined system message instead of its internal default, allowing full customization of the model’s tone, persona, or task-specific behavior.

## Notes

* Only the **first** system message is used; additional system messages later in the sequence are ignored.
* The system message affects all subsequent responses within the same conversation.
* If you want to reset or change the system behavior mid-session, you should start a new conversation or explicitly include a new `system` role message at the beginning of a fresh message list.
