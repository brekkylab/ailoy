# MCP Integration

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol developed by Anthropic
to standardize how language models interact with external systems—such as tools,
memory backends, and context managers. MCP enables structured, dynamic
communication between an LLM and its environment, empowering models to access
external tools, retrieve real-time information, and perform complex, multi-step
reasoning.

:::info

Standard input/output is not available in the web environment. Therefore, only
the MCP tools based on streamable HTTP are available in the web environment.  
For information on MCP integration in the web environment, please refer to the
**[WebAssembly Supports](webassembly-supports#using-mcp-tools)**.

The following examples demonstrate MCP tools that use standard input/output only
in a native environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Loading MCP Clients

You can connect to any MCP server using the MCPClient interface. For example,
the snippet below connects to the official GitHub MCP server.

<CodeTabs>

```python
client = await ai.MCPClient.from_stdio(
    "npx", ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
)
```

```typescript
const client = await ai.MCPClient.newStdio("npx", [
  "-y",
  "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
]);
```

</CodeTabs>

This launches the GitHub MCP server as a subprocess using standard I/O for
communication. The agent automatically discovers the tools exposed by the server
and registers them to its internal toolset.

### Extracting MCP Tools

Each MCP server can expose multiple tools. To optimize context usage, you can
selectively extract a subset of tools rather than registering all of them.

<CodeTabs>

```python
tools = [
    client.get_tool("search_repositories"),
    client.get_tool("get_file_contents"),
]
```

```typescript
const tools = [
  client.getTool("search_repositories"),
  client.getTool("get_file_contents"),
];
```

</CodeTabs>

### Registering Tools into Agent

To integrate MCP tools with LM, they must be registered to `Agent`.  
Once registered, the agent can automatically invoke these tools during reasoning
or when responding to user queries.

<CodeTabs>

```python
lm = await ai.LangModel.new_local("Qwen/Qwen3-8B", progress_callback=print)
agent = ai.Agent(lm, tools)
```

```typescrpt
const lm = await ai.LangModel.newLocal("Qwen/Qwen3-8B", null, console.log);
const agent = new ai.Agent(lm, tools);
```

</CodeTabs>

### Querying via MCP Tools

With tools registered, the agent can automatically use them when you invoke
`run()` or `run_delta()`.

<CodeTabs>

```python
question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
async for resp in agent.run(question):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
const question =
  "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
for await (const resp of agent.run(question)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

This demonstrates how the agent leverages the GitHub MCP tools to search
repositories and summarize their contents.

## Complete Example

The following end-to-end example demonstrates how to set up an agent, connect to
the GitHub MCP server, and issue a query.

<CodeTabs>

```python
import asyncio

import ailoy as ai


async def main():
    client = await ai.MCPClient.from_stdio(
        "npx", ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    )
    tools = [
        client.get_tool("search_repositories"),
        client.get_tool("get_file_contents"),
    ]
    lm = await ai.LangModel.new_local("Qwen/Qwen3-4B", progress_callback=print)
    agent = ai.Agent(lm, tools)
    query = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
    async for resp in agent.run(query):
        print(resp)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript
import * as ai from "ailoy-node";

async function main() {
  const client = await ai.MCPClient.newStdio("npx", [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
  ]);
  const tools = [
    client.getTool("search_repositories"),
    client.getTool("get_file_contents"),
  ];
  const lm = await ai.LangModel.newLocal("Qwen/Qwen3-4B", null, console.log);
  const agent = new ai.Agent(lm, tools);
  const query =
    "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
  for await (const resp of agent.run(query)) {
    console.log(resp.message);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error:", err);
});
```
