# Managing Model Files

Language models(LMs) usually contain a very large number of parameters, ranging
from megabytes to gigabytes in total size. In addition, they require extra files
for chat templates, tokenization, and other supplementary data.

By default, Ailoy automatically downloads the required model files if they are
not already present on the system. These files are stored in the following
locations depending on your environment:

| Environment | Model cache root path                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux       | `~/.cache/ailoy`                                                                                                                 |
| macOS       | `~/.cache/ailoy`                                                                                                                 |
| Windows     | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ailoy`                                                                                                           |

## CLI tool

Ailoy also provides a Command-Line Interface(CLI) tool that helps you to manage
the model files directly.
