# Managing Model Files

Language models (LMs) usually contain very large size of parameters. This
ranging from megabytes to gigabytes. In addition, they require extra files for
chat templates, tokenization, and other supplementary data.

By default, Ailoy automatically downloads the required model files if they are
not already present on the system. These files are stored in the following
locations depending on your operating system:

| OS          | Model cache root path                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux       | `~/.cache/ailoy`                                                                                                                 |
| macOS       | `~/.cache/ailoy`                                                                                                                 |
| Windows     | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ailoy`                                                                                                           |
| WebAssembly | [Origin Private File System (OPFS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system) |

Ailoy also provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to download
and delete model files directly.

Model names follow the same naming convention as those registered on
