# Managing Model Files

Language models (LMs) usually contain very large size of parameters.
This ranging from megabytes to gigabytes.
In addition, they require extra files for chat templates, tokenization, and other supporting data.

By default, Ailoy automatically downloads the required model files if they are not already present on the system.
These files are stored in the following locations depending on your operating system:

| OS | Model cache root path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.cache/ailoy` |
| macOS | `~/.cache/ailoy` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ailoy` |
| Webassembly | `https://ailoy.co`(OPFS) |

Ailoy also provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to download and delete model files directly.

Model names follow the same naming convention as those registered on HuggingFace.
