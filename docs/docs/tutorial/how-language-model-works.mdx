# Interlude: How Language Model Works

A **language model** is a type of AI system that can understand and generate natural language.
You can think of it as a highly advanced autocomplete engine.
It predicts what words or sentences should come next based on the context it has already seen.
Trained on massive datasets, it can hold meaningful conversations, write code, summarize documents, and even reason about complex problems.
Yet, in a way, itâ€™s a simple system at its core.

A language model works iteratively.
It takes as input a sequence of text and outputs a continuation of that sequence.
Then, in the next step, the generated output is appended to the input, and the model generates the next token.
This process repeats until the model emits a special stop token, signaling the end of generation.
