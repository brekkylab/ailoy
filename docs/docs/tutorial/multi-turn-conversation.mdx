# Multi-Turn Conversation

Ailoy's `Agent` is designed to be stateless.
It does not keep track of conversations.
Each time you call the model, Ailoy treats it as an new request.

If you want to create a multi-turn chat — for example, a back-and-forth conversation with the assistant — you must include the entire conversation history (all previous messages) in the request.

## Example

Let’s start with a simple one-turn conversation:

```
from ailoy import Agent, LangModel

lm = LangModel(model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B")
agent = Agent(lm)

response = agent.run([
  { "role": "user", "contents": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello!" }] }
])
print(response)
```

The model will respond to "Hello!" normally.
Now, if you want to continue the conversation, you must pass both the previous messages and the new user message again:

```
messages = [
  { "role": "user", "contents": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello!" }] },
  { "role": "assistant", "contents": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hi there! How can I help you today?" }] },
  { "role": "user", "contents": [{ "type": "text", "text": "What did I just say?" }] }
]

response = agent.run(messages)
print(response)
```

Ailoy will now use the full conversation context to produce the correct reply — even though it doesn’t persist any state internally.
