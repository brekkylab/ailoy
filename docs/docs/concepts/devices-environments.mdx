# Devices & Environments

**On-device AI** is one of biggest feature of Ailoy that make it different from
other AI tools.  
To make it feasible, you might need to check the conditions for the devices &
environments to run AIs.

Requirements for available VRAM size by models are estimated as follows:

| Model                | Context length | VRAM (params) | VRAM (total) |
| -------------------- | :------------: | :-----------: | :----------: |
| `BAAI/bge-m3`        |       8k       |   ≈ 0.3 GB    |   ≈ 0.3 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`    |      40k       |   ≈ 0.5 GB    |   ≈ 5.0 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B`    |      40k       |   ≈ 1.0 GB    |   ≈ 5.5 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-4B`      |      40k       |   ≈ 2.4 GB    |   ≈ 8.0 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`      |      40k       |   ≈ 4.5 GB    |  ≈ 10.5 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-14B`     |      40k       |   ≈ 8.0 GB    |  ≈ 14.5 GB   |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-32B`     |      40k       |   ≈ 17.6 GB   |   ≈ 25 GB    |
