# Supported Environments

## For Agents with LLM APIs

You can create _your own agent_ with **Ailoy** using external APIs such as
OpenAI, Claude, Gemini or Grok.  
Your system doesn't need to meet the hardware requirements with these APIs.

## For Agents with AI running locally

**Local AI** is one of biggest feature of Ailoy that make it different from
other AI tools. To make it feasible, you might need to check the conditions for
the devices & environments to run AIs.

AI models typically consume a significant amount of memory.

The exact usage depends on the model size, but we recommend at least **8GB of
GPU memory**. Running the Qwen 8B model requires at least **12GB of GPU
memory**. On macOS, this refers to unified memory, as Apple Silicon uses a
shared memory architecture.

Please refer to **[Available Models](available-models#vram-requirements)** for
more information.
