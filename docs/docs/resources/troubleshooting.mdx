# Troubleshooting

## I can't import Ailoy on Python or Node.js.

### Windows & Linux

Ailoy requires a properly installed GPU driver **with Vulkan support**. If
Vulkan isn't available—or if the GPU driver is missing or incorrectly
installed—you may see import-time errors caused by missing symbols during
dynamic linking.

To fix this:

- Ensure your GPU drivers are correctly installed.
- Confirm that Vulkan is available by running `vulkaninfo` (see below).

### macOS

Ailoy currently supports **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4...) only**. Intel-based
Macs are **not supported** due to missing GPU and API capabilities.

For full details, see the [Supported Environments](./supported-environments.mdx)
page.

## My code is running very slow on Linux.

On Linux, Ailoy may fall back to using **llvmpipe**, a CPU-based Vulkan
implementation provided by Mesa. Because llvmpipe does not use GPU acceleration,
any model execution will be extremely slow.

Run `vulkaninfo` to inspect the Vulkan devices:

```bash
$ vulkaninfo --summary

# if `vulkaninfo` is missing:
$ sudo apt-get install vulkan-tools
```

If you see a device like this:

```bash
GPU1:
	apiVersion         = 1.4.305
	driverVersion      = 0.0.1
	vendorID           = 0x10005
	deviceID           = 0x0000
	deviceType         = PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU
	deviceName         = llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits)
	driverID           = DRIVER_ID_MESA_LLVMPIPE
	driverName         = llvmpipe
	driverInfo         = Mesa 25.0.7-0ubuntu0.24.04.2 (LLVM 20.1.2)
	conformanceVersion = 1.3.1.1
	deviceUUID         = 6d657361-3235-2e30-2e37-2d3075627500
	driverUUID         = 6c6c766d-7069-7065-5555-494400000000
```

then your system is using the llvmpipe Vulkan device.

Remove the Mesa Vulkan software driver that provides llvmpipe:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

After removal, run `vulkaninfo` again to confirm that your actual GPU driver is
now being used.
